## 🦁🦓 Assignment: Lions and Zebras — 2D Hunt

You are given a 2D grid representing a savanna.
Each cell in the grid can contain:

* `'L'` — a ** lion **
* `'Z'` — a ** zebra **
* `' '` — empty grassland

Your task is to find ** the zebra most in danger **, defined as the zebra with the ** shortest distance to any lion **.

### 📏 Distance Metrics

There are two ways to measure distance on the grid:

1. ** Manhattan distance ** (grid distance)

   Manhattan distance counts the number of ** horizontal and vertical steps ** it takes to move from one point to another, ignoring diagonals.

  Formula:  [ d_\text{ Manhattan } = | x_2 - x_1 | + | y_2 - y_1 | ]

Example:
   * Lion at`(0,0)`
  * Zebra at`(1,2)`

    * Manhattan distance = | 1 − 0 | + | 2 − 0 | = 3


2. ** Euclidean distance ** (straight - line distance)

   Euclidean distance measures the ** direct straight - line distance ** between two points.

  Formula: [ d_\text{ Euclidean } = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1) ^ 2 + (y_2 - y_1) ^ 2} ]

   Using the same points:

   * Lion at`(0,0)`
  * Zebra at`(1,2)`

    * Euclidean distance = (\sqrt{ (1 - 0) ^ 2 + (2 - 0) ^ 2 } = \sqrt{ 1 + 4 } = \sqrt{ 5 } \approx 2.236)

### 📝 Assignment Requirements

1. Write a function `findShortestDist2D(grid, metric)` where:

   * `grid` is an array of strings representing rows of the savanna.
   * `metric` is either `'manhattan'` or`'euclidean'`.

2. The function should return ** the shortest distance between any lion and any zebra ** according to the chosen metric.

3. If no lions or no zebras are present, return `null`.

### 💡 Example Usage
  ```js

const grid = [
  "L   ",
  "  Z ",
  "   Z"
];

console.log(findShortestDist2D(grid, 'manhattan')); // → 3
console.log(findShortestDist2D(grid, 'euclidean')); // → ≈ 2.236

```
